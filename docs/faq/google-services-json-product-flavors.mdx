# File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it. 

Even though Firebase is initialized from the Dart side with this command:

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);
```

Running the app on Android without the `google-services.json` file inside `android/app` may cause this error:

```
Launching lib/main_staging.dart on sdk gphone x86 in debug mode...
lib/main_staging.dart:1

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:

```

The solution is to copy the `google-services.json` **for each flavor** into the correct directory (for example: `android/app/src/staging/google-services.json`).
