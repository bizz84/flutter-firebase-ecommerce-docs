# "Failed to load network image" on Flutter web builds

When running Flutter web for the first time on a new Firebase project, images may fail to load:

```
Failed to load network image.

```

The solution is to open the [GCloud Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) for the current project.

Then, click on "Activate Google Cloud Shell" on the top right corner:

On the terminal, run the following:

```
echo '[{"origin": ["*"],"responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],"method": ["GET", "HEAD"],"maxAgeSeconds": 3600}]' > cors-config.json
```

Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your actual bucket name in the following command to update the cors-settings from your bucket:

```
gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
```
