# Installation 

## Downloading the source code

You can download source code snapshots from the [course](#) lectures.

These snapshots will include both the **Flutter** and **Cloud Functions** code needed to run the project.

However, some Firebase configuration files will be missing:

Here's how to generate them:

## Firebase setup

Install the [`flutterfire_cli`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterfire_cli) from the command line:

```
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

TODO: Image.

Then, generate the missing `firebase_options_dev.dart`, `firebase_options_staging.dart`, and `firebase_options_prod.dart` files like this:


TODO: Complete
```
flutterfire config \
```

This will automatically generate Firebase projects to match the package name / bundle ID of the Flutter client.

## Stripe setup

- Register for a Stripe developer account
- generate api keys
- set them with `firebase config:set`

## Very Good CLI

The Flutter demo project was created using [Very Good CLI](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli), which offers [build flavors](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/flavors), continuous integration, and much more out of the box.

This can be installed from the command line:

```
dart pub global activate very_good_cli
```
