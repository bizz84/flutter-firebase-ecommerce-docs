# Search with Algolia: Setup steps

This page is a work in progress.

## Register for a new Algolia account

## Create a new Algolia application

## Create a new API Key and add the `search`, `addObject`, `deleteObject` ACLs

## Configure the extension

This can be done by installing in the Firebase console, or using the Firebase CLI, from this page:

- [Search with Algolia | Firebase Extensions](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/algolia-firestore-algolia-search)

### Indexable fields

These are the fields that are returned as part of the search results.

Leave empty to match all the fields in the original Firestore documents (this also means that the same data models and parsing code can be reused).

### Searchable attributes

In the Algolia Index Configuration page, the correct **searchable attributes** need to be set. These are used to match the search query with the fields in the document.

### Generating the index data

The index data is generated automatically when the Firestore documents are changed.

This means that any **previously existing** Firestore documents will **not** be indexed.

One way around this is to delete all the Firestore data and generate it again, as this will trigger the indexing.

If this is not an option, consider using the [Algolia Importing API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-with-the-api/).
