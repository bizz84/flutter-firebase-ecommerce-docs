# Firestore Database migrations

**Example: Change cart items from a list to a map.**

Affected documents:

- `/users/{userId}/private/cart`
- `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`

## Defensive code on client

Added some code in `cart.dart` to deal with the old format in Firestore.

```dart
  static Map<String, int> _parseItems(dynamic value) {
    if (value is List<dynamic>) {
      final items = List<Item>.from(value.map((x) => Item.fromMap(x)));
      return Map<String, int>.fromEntries(
          items.map((item) => MapEntry(item.productId, item.quantity)));
    } else if (value is Map<String, dynamic>) {
      return Map<String, int>.from(value);
    } else {
      throw ArgumentError('Invalid items: $value');
    }
  }
```

## Reasons for migration

### Cart

Users running the live app may choose to checkout a shopping cart that was using the old format.

If the updated cloud functions are running, this will cause a failure in order fullfillment.

So it's necessary to migrate all cart items to the new format (or wipe the shopping cart for existing users).

### Orders

Orders data is safe to be stored in the old format as long as the new client has some defensive code.

### Old clients

Once the updated cloud functions are deployed, the web app will be deployed as well so everyone gets the new code.

Though if the app was deployed to the app store, a force upgrade would be required.
