# Stripe Integration

## Stripe payment workflow

When the user clicks on the "Pay" button in the app, `CheckoutService.pay()` is called.

In turn, the `createOrderPaymentIntent` cloud function is called, which:

- checks if all items are in stock and calculates the cart total
- finds or creates a Stripe customer for the user `uid` (this also 
- writes a document into `customers/${customerId}` with the `uid` of the user so that later on we can do a reverse-lookup
- creates a payment intent (`createPaymentIntent`), which returns the necessary data to the client

Next, the payment sheet is initialized and presented in two stages:

1. the user address is retrieved and used to initialize the payment sheet (via `StripeRepository.initPaymentSheet()`)
2. `presentPaymentSheet()` is called

At this point, the payment sheet UI is presented and the user can make the payment.

If `payment_intent.succeeded` is received, `fullfillOrder` is called, which in turn:

- retrieves the user `uid` with a reverse-lookup in `customers/${customerId}`
- copies all the cart items into an array and removes them from the cart
- creates an order document with all the details in  `users/${uid}/orders/${orderId}`
- deletes the cart document

As a result, the user can see the new order appear in the list of orders in the app

### TODO

- store the `lastOrderId` in `customers/${customerId}`
