# Client vs Server-side Search for Products List

The eCommerce app has a search box in the products page.

When the user enters some text in the search box, the list of products is filtered to show only those that match the search query.

While implementing this, two strategies have been evaulated.

## Client-side Search

This is ideal when the number of products is small (less than 100).

It is implemented using a `ProductsSearchService` class, which works as follows:

- whenever the search text changes, the `search(String query)` method is called
- in turn, this adds the query to a `Stream` of search terms
- internally, all search terms are debounced to reduce the number of requests sent to the server
- then, the **entire product list** is pulled from the server and filtered using the search query

This is how the filtering looks like:

```dart
Future<List<Product>> searchProducts(String query) async {
    // 1. Get all products from server
    final productsList = await getProductsList();
    // 2. Perform filtering client-side
    return productsList
        .where((product) =>
            product.title.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
        .toList();
}
```

This allows us to implement "full-text" search on the product title, which is not something that is supported by Firestore.

The drawback is that the products list is pulled from the server every time the search text changes.

### Possible optimizations

To optimize this, we could cache the products list locally (since it rarely ever changes), and do the filtering based on that.

## Server-side Search with Algolia

Client-side search works for the product list, but becomes very inefficient for large collections.

In such case, full-text search should be done on the server.

This is **not** supported by Firebase, and the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/solutions/search) recommends to use 3rd party services such as Elastic, Algolia, or Typesense.

Search with Algolia is supported as a [Firebase Extension](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/algolia-firestore-algolia-search), making it easy to setup.

The only drawback is the [pricing](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/), which is fairly expensive.

## Notes

Since the eCommerce app is a project for demonstration purposes, the client-side search is used.

For more info on setting up Algolia, see the [Search with Algolia setup page](/how-to/search-with-algolia).
